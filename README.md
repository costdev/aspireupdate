# AspireUpdate

This plugin allows a WordPress user to automatically rewrite certain URLs and URL paths to a new URL. This is
helpful because it allows for the rewriting of `api.wordpress.org` to some other repository that contains the plugins
the user wants.

The plugin supports multiple rewrites, and also supports rewriting the URL paths of the requests on a per-host basis.
This improves the capacity of the plugin to adequately support newer or different repositories.

## Requirements

This plugin requires:

- WordPress 5.3 or later
- PHP 7.4 or later
- The ability to upload files to your WordPress installation
- The ability to modify your configuration in wp-config.php

6. Configure the plugin if necessary with the user interface.
7. Test and enjoy!

## Configuration

| Configuration Parameter |                                                                                              Description |                        Default, if any |
| :---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | -------------------------------------: |
| AP_ENABLE               |                                                                                       Enable API rewrite |                                  false |
| AP_API_KEY              |                                                     The API Key for AspireCloud (not currently enforced) |                                        |
| AP_HOST                 |                                                                                          API domain name |                    api.aspirecloud.org |
| AP_DEBUG                |                                                                                        Enable Debug Mode |                                  false |
| AP_DEBUG_TYPES          |                                                                                  an array of debug modes | array('string', 'request', 'response') |
| AP_DISABLE_SSL          |                                                              Disabled SSL verification for local testing |                                   true |
| AP_REMOVE_UI            | Disables plugin settings user interface and branding, defaults to config parameters set in wp-config.php |                                  false |

To set AP_DEBUG_TYPES use an array to define the constant:

```php
// Works as of PHP 7
define('AP_DEBUG_TYPES', array(
    'string', 'request', 'response'
));
```

NOTE: Any AspirePress configuration parameters set in wp-config.php _will_ override any plugin options set in the plugin user interface.

NOTE 2: Setting AP_REMOVE_UI to `true` removes the plugin user interface. This is intended to be used in situations where AspireUpdate is deployed in a pre-configured mode and end-user configuration is not expected nor allowed.

## WP Playgrounds Support

The AspireUpdate current build ('main' branch) can be [experimented with in the WP Playground environment](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspirepress/aspireupdate/refs/heads/main/assets/playground/blueprint.json).

The AspireUpdate stable build ('playground-ready' branch) can be [tested with in the WP Playground environment](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspirepress/aspireupdate/refs/heads/playground-ready/assets/playground/blueprint.json).

## Debug Logging

The AspireUpdate log file is located under /wp-content and named "debug-aspire-update.log".

## Authentication

Authentication is provided by way of a randomly generated token combined with the `WP_SITEURL` constant. This token is
then Base64-encoded with the separate parts of the credentials separated by a colon. It's added to the `Authorization`
header.

## License

This plugin is licensed under the GPLv2, as it is a WordPress plugin and that is the license required.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Here's a short to-do list:

- Add support for more complex rewrites. Right now we only support simple string matching, but it would be nice to support pattern matching, too.
- Add support for more complex debugging. Right now we only support outputting strings, but it would be nice to support more complex debugging.
- Add support for verifying that the repository can be reached, and if not, reverting back to the original repository.
- Add support for multiple repositories, in a priority order. This would allow for multiple fallbacks.
- Add support for additional header management. Right now the plugin is designed to add a simple Authentication header, which is not always needed. Other repositories might have different authentication requirements.

## Support

If you need help with this plugin, please file an issue explaining the following:

- What you did

Issues that are not filed with this information will be closed. We will do our best to assist, but we cannot guarantee a response.
