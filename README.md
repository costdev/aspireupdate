# AspireUpdate

This plugin allows a WordPress user to automatically rewrite certain URLs and URL paths to a new URL. This is
helpful because it allows for the rewriting of `api.wordpress.org` to some other repository that contains the plugins
the user wants.

The plugin supports multiple rewrites, and also supports rewriting the URL paths of the requests on a per-host basis.
This improves the capacity of the plugin to adequately support newer or different repositories.

## Requirements

This plugin requires:

- WordPress 5.3 or later
- PHP 7.4 or later
- The ability to upload files to your WordPress installation

| AP_HOST                        |                                                                                          API domain name |                                        api.aspirecloud.net |
| AP_COMPATIBILITY               |                                                                Configure various compatibility measures. |     array( 'skip_rewriting_on_existing_response' => true ) |
| AP_DEBUG                       |                                                                                        Enable Debug Mode |                                                      false |
| AP_DEBUG_TYPES                 |                                                                                  an array of debug modes |                     array('string', 'request', 'response') |
| AP_DISABLE_SSL                 |                                                              Disabled SSL verification for local testing |                                                       true |
| AP_REMOVE_UI                   | Disables plugin settings user interface and branding, defaults to config parameters set in wp-config.php |                                                      false |

To set AP_COMPATIBILITY use an array to define the constant:

```php
// Works as of PHP 7
define('AP_COMPATIBILITY', array(
    'skip_rewriting_on_existing_response' => true
));
```

To set AP_DEBUG_TYPES use an array to define the constant:

```php
// Works as of PHP 7
define('AP_DEBUG_TYPES', array(
    'string', 'request', 'response'
));
```

NOTE: Any AspirePress configuration parameters set in wp-config.php _will_ override any plugin options set in the plugin user interface.

NOTE 2: Setting AP_REMOVE_UI to `true` removes the plugin user interface. This is intended to be used in situations where AspireUpdate is deployed in a pre-configured mode and end-user configuration is not expected nor allowed.

## WP Playgrounds Support

The AspireUpdate stable build ('playground-ready' branch) can be [tested with in the WP Playground environment](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspirepress/aspireupdate/refs/heads/playground-ready/assets/playground/blueprint.json).

## License

This plugin is licensed under the GPLv2, as it is a WordPress plugin and that is the license required.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Here's a short to-do list:

- Add support for more complex rewrites. Right now we only support simple string matching, but it would be nice to support pattern matching, too.
- Add support for more complex debugging. Right now we only support outputting strings, but it would be nice to support more complex debugging.
- Add support for verifying that the repository can be reached, and if not, reverting back to the original repository.
- Add support for multiple repositories, in a priority order. This would allow for multiple fallbacks.
- Add support for additional header management. Right now the plugin is designed to add a simple Authentication header, which is not always needed. Other repositories might have different authentication requirements.
